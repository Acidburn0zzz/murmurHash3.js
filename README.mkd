# MurmurHash3.js
**A javascript implementation of [MurmurHash3](http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/source/browse/trunk/MurmurHash3.cpp?spec=svn145&r=144)'s x86 hashing algorithms.**

## Usage
```javascript
// Return a hash as a 32bit unsigned int:
murmurHash3.hash32("I will not buy this record, it is scratched.") // 2832214938

// Return a hash as a 128bit unsigned hex:
murmurHash3.hash128("I will not buy this tobacconist's, it is scratched.") // "ef3f78669b5b7ba200f3f98e889adeaf"

// Specify a seed (defaults to 0):
murmurHash3.hash32("My hovercraft is full of eels.", 25) // 2520298415

// Rebind murmurHash3:
somethingCompletelyDifferent = murmurHash3.noConflict()
```
